# PDF to JPG Converter

I decided to make this because I had a bunch of .pdf files to convert to .jpg.
instead of downloading something or using another tool why not code it myself :).

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Must utilize poppler folder in repository.
* Poppler handles file conversion.

### Executing Program

* Run the `pdftojpg.py` file or inside the `open_me` directory run the `.exe` version.
* Set `Path` by browsing to the `pdf2jpg/poppler-22.12.0/Library/bin` directory.
* Set path to file/files you want to convert with the `Browse` button.
* Once set, click `Convert`
* A `Success` message box will alert you if conversion is successful, else it will display error.
